  In this project, I look at five of the different design features used by this Pratt & Whitney engine that I 
  believe are key to its success. I also provide brief explanations of how turbojet, ramjet and scramjet engines 
  work before going on to talk about which elements from these engines were applied to the SR-71. Using data from 
  various sources alongside the aircraft’s flight manual, I was able to understand how each of these systems 
  function and how they contributed to the performance of the engine at supersonic speeds. I found that special 
  bleed air bypass valves alongside a very unique inlet design were some of the biggest contributors, with these 
  elements producing significantly more power than the actual turbine at supersonic speeds. While I found the bypass 
  valves to be the most significant feature, I concluded that all of these elements required each other for the 
  engine to function properly and so they were all vastly important to the operation of the aircraft.

<h3 class="ex2" id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p class="ex1" id="Introduction_InText">
  This project will discuss the key features that enabled the SR-71 to sustain supersonic speeds for hours at a time. 
  Although many elements contributed to this, I will be focusing primarily on the engine and intakes. I will first focus 
  on how different engines work, allowing for a better understanding of the specifics I talk about later. Then, having 
  looked at some base statistics for the engine, I will examine certain elements of the engine which are crucial to its 
  supersonic capabilities including the bypass ducts, intakes and fuel. This will give an insight as to how the SR-71 
  could sustain supersonic flight for extended periods <a href="#Pace, S. (2016)">(Pace, 2016)</a>.

<h3 class="ex2" id="Analysis and discussion">Analysis and discussion</h3>
<p class="ex1" id="Analysis and discussion_Intext">
  To understand the concepts of the SR-71’s engines, it is important to first have an idea of how three of the base 
  engine types function.
<br>
<br>
  Starting with the turbojet engine, this draws air in at the front using stages of fans which compress the air, making 
  it denser and denser <a href="#Hall, N. (2021a)">(Hall, 2021a)</a>. This dense air is then combusted causing it to expand rapidly, before getting 
  expelled out from exhaust nozzle at a very high pressure and speed relative to when it entered the engine <a href="#Derbel, K. and Beneda, K. (2025)">(Derbel and Beneda, 2025)</a>. 
  Since it has fans which compress the air, it can run when stationary, drawing in air to compress <a href="#Hall, N. (2021b)">(Hall, 2021b)</a>.
<br>
<br>
  A ramjet works in the same way except it doesn’t have fans to compress the air, using a diffuser instead. Because of this, 
  these engines only start to work at speeds over Mach 1 as the diffuser requires air ramming into it, allowing it to slow the 
  air down to subsonic speeds before compressing it, thereby creating the high pressures needed for combustion <a href="#Gerbis, N. (2024)">(Gerbis, 2024)</a>.
<br>
<br>
  Finally, a scramjet works similarly to a ramjet, but instead of slowing down the airflow to subsonic speeds, it compresses 
  and combusts it while it is still at supersonic speed <a href="#Hall, N. (2021c)">(Hall, 2021c)</a>. This greatly reduces the drag as there is less air 
  resistance slowing the aircraft down.
<br>
<br>
  The SR-71 used two afterburning, axial-flow, continuous-bleed Pratt & Whitney J58 (JT11D-20) Turbojet Engines <a href="#Pace, S. (2016)">(Pace, 2016)</a> with 
  each engine producing 34,000 pounds of thrust <a href="#Admin, S. (2017)">(Admin, 2017)</a> with afterburner (at sea level in a static condition). The aircraft 
  weighed roughly 140,000 pounds at take-off <a href="#NASA (2008)">(NASA, 2008)</a> giving a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1:0.486 which improved throughout 
  the flight, as fuel was used, ending each mission with a thrust ratio of nearly 1:1. The turbofan part of the engine had 9 fans 
  which would sequentially compress the air to 8.8 times the intake pressure <a href="#airandspace.si.edu. (n.d.).">(airandspace.si.edu, n.d.)</a> before it was combusted in 
  the core. 
<br>
<br>
  
<img class="ex5" src="Airflow patterns figure.png" alt="Airflow patterns" width="478" height="567">
  
  One feature that made this engine so special were the bleed valves that ran from the intake to the afterburner, bypassing some 
  compressor stages. These valves would open at around Mach 2 (see Figure 1), channelling air directly into the fuel spray rings in 
  the afterburner <a href="#SENIOR CROWN Program Security Classification Guide (1986)">(SENIOR CROWN Program Security Classification Guide, 1986)</a>. This transition reduced the airflow into the turbine 
  from 80% to just 8% as valves channelled more and more to the afterburner, effectively converting the engine into a ramjet <a href="#Admin, S. (2017)">(Admin, 2017)</a>. 
  With most of the air now bypassing the compressor, the engineers needed to find different ways to compress the air. This 
  was achieved with a unique inlet design.
<br>
<br>
  At the front of each inlet is a spike that moved forwards and backwards, altering the amount of airflow and, at supersonic speeds, 
  the shape of the shockwave. For engine start-up and all speeds under Mach 1.6, the spike was pushed fully forward. However, at higher 
  speeds, the spike would pull back 1.625 inches per 0.1 increment increase in Mach number <a href="#D’Urso, S. (2019)">(D’Urso, 2019)</a> as seen in Figure 1. By 
  reducing the size of the throat, the air is channelled through, this simultaneously increased the volume and the density of air 
  channelled through the inlet, providing the engine with more oxygen which enabled it to burn more fuel and ultimately produce more 
  thrust.
<br>
<br>
  Two key parts of the exhaust nozzle at the rear of the engine were also designed to improve the function of the engine. The ejector 
  flaps altered the volume of the exhaust nozzle allowing large changes in the speed and density of the air traveling through the 
  engine. At sub-sonic speeds, the flaps were closed, decreasing the volume of the exhaust nozzle and forcing the air out of a smaller 
  gap and therefore at a higher speed. At this speed, the tertiary doors between the compressor and exhaust opened adding more air into 
  the exhaust nozzle, increasing the pressure further. As the aircraft approached Mach 1.5, the tertiary doors closed and the exhaust 
  nozzle widened as the pressure and speed of the airflow increases. This continued until the aircraft hit its top speed of about Mach 
  3.2 where the output of the exhaust nozzle was wider than the input <a href="#SENIOR CROWN Program Security Classification Guide (1986)">(SENIOR CROWN Program Security Classification Guide, 1986)</a>.
<br>
<br>
  Since the engines operated under a unique set of parameters, a special fuel, JP-7 was developed <a href="#Admin, S. (2017)">(Admin, 2017)</a>. The aircraft needed 
  to be as light as possible therefore instead of using separate cooling systems and coolant, they used the fuel to draw heat away 
  from various components related to and around the engines. This required a fuel that wouldn’t break down under such temperatures 
  and contained enough lubricant to ensure the components ran smoothly. Additionally, the fuel burned with a very bright flame, 
  reducing the heat transferred to parts in the afterburner. At full power, the two engines would use over 50,000 gallons of this 
  fuel per hour <a href="#Davis, B.J. (2017)">(Davis, 2017)</a>.
<br>
<br>
  In conclusion, there are lots of key elements which allow this engine to function as it does. In my opinion, the most crucial is 
  the bypass system that converts this engine into a ramjet as that provides the power and efficiency to sustain Mach 3 flight. That 
  being said, the engine wouldn’t function as successfully as it does if any of these design elements were removed.
